Healthcare Records System
A secure and efficient electronic healthcare records (EHR) system designed to manage patient medical histories, appointments, prescriptions, billing, and clinical documentation. This platform aims to streamline healthcare workflows, improve patient care coordination, and ensure compliance with healthcare data security and privacy standards.

Overview
This Healthcare Records System provides a centralized digital solution for medical staff and patients to store, access, and update medical records seamlessly. It supports multiple user roles including patients, doctors, front office staff, and administrators, each with role-specific access and permissions to maintain data confidentiality and integrity.

Features

Medical Records: Secure storage and access to diagnostic reports, prescriptions, treatment plans, and visit notes.

Medication Tracking: Prescription management with dosages, frequencies, and refill tracking.

Billing and Payments: Manage medical bills including insurance claims, outstanding payments, and transaction history.

Role-Based Access Control: Ensure data privacy by restricting access based on user roles (Doctor, Patient, Admin, Front Desk).

Audit Trails: Track access and changes to patient records for compliance and security.

Notifications: Automated alerts for appointments, prescription refills, and billing events.

How It Works
